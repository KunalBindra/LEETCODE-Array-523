# LEETCODE-Array-523
This code seems to implement a solution to the problem of finding if there exists a contiguous subarray of length at least 2 with a sum that is a multiple of a given integer `k`. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes a prefix sum (`prefix`) to 0 and a hashmap (`prefixToIndex`) to store the prefix sums encountered so far along with their indices.
2. It sets the initial prefix sum to 0 with an index of -1 in the hashmap.
3. It iterates through the array `nums`, updating the prefix sum by adding the current element.
4. If `k` is not zero, it takes the modulus of the current prefix sum with `k`.
5. It checks if the current prefix sum exists in the hashmap. If it does, it checks if the difference between the current index and the index stored in the hashmap for that prefix sum is greater than 1. If it is, it returns true, indicating the presence of a subarray with a sum divisible by `k`.
6. If the current prefix sum does not exist in the hashmap, it adds it along with its index to the hashmap.
7. If no such subarray is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns false.

This algorithm works by keeping track of the remainder of the cumulative sum modulo `k` and checking if the same remainder occurs at different indices, indicating the presence of a subarray whose sum is a multiple of `k`.
